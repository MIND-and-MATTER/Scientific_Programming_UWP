This program is designed to take a user input of Kelvin temperature. Data relating to molecular gasses will be extracted from a file. 
Calculations will return probability functions for the velocities of gas particles at the given temperature. Computations to output a 
graphical representation of these functions will occur and the results will be displayed

# 3. Function definitions
# 4. if __name__ == "__main__" block, which calls a primary function with a clear name 

# All code is inside function definitions for simulation solution & visualization (functional programming)
#	Each function contains a docstring compliant with PEP 257: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/
#	Module ends with if __name__ == "__main__" block to execute central function of the code

# Primary simulation function structure
#	1. Module imports
#		Use SciPy constants for physical constants in particular function (not globally)
#			https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/constants.html
#		Follow best practice order: 
#			https://docs.python.org/3/faq/programming.html#what-are-the-best-practices-for-using-import-in-a-module
# 	2. Simulation parameters
#		Each parameter named clearly and units marked in in-line comment
#		Naming of all variables should comply with PEP 8: 
#			https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#documentation-strings
#			(lower_case_with_underscores)
# 	3. Computed parameters (from simulation parameters)
# 	4. Function calls (use PEP 8-compliant lower_case_with_underscores) and simple calculations for:
#		data read-in
#		simulation solution 
#		visualization
